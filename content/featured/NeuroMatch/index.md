In July of 2023, I participated in the [three-week summer school](https://compneuro.neuromatch.io/tutorials/intro.html) on computational neuroscience at [NeuroMatch Academy](https://academy.neuromatch.io/), which offers tutorials and extensive insights into research methodologies.

Collaborating with PhD students, we worked on a research project focusing on modeling working memory as a recurrent neural network, comparing random and structured sub-networks.
