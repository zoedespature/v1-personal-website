In a team of 5, we won the [Imperial College Health Hack](https://ic-health-hack-19.devpost.com/project-gallery), powered by Prudential, in the "Wearable Posture Adjusting Device" category.

In SpineAlign, we implemented a posture trainer and electronic foot sole using Arduinos and multiple sensors, with data wirelessly transferred to an associated Swift app.
