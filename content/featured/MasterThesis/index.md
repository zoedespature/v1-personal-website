I had the privilege of working in [Prof. Dr. Dario Farina](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0JDIQ0wAAAAJ&hl=en)'s lab alongside his postdocs at Imperial College London.

This research project addressed the challenge of wearable exoskeletons, focusing on improving the dynamic responses while giving users full control priority. Our approach involved using EMG signals to estimate human joint torque, successfully identifying and reducing impedance between the user and the exoskeleton. The results demonstrated up to 61.94% accuracy in capturing previously unaccounted-for characteristics.
