In [Professor Claudia Clopath's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudia_Clopath) class, my group and I analyzed neural spike train data to decode a monkey's motor cortex activity. We classified the arm movement angle using Linear Discriminant Analysis and decoded the trajectory with a Kalman filter.
